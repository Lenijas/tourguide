# FIWARE TourGuide CLI and helper scripts #

This directory contains the helper scripts needed for the different commands and subcommands available through the `tour-guide` CLI script.  Each of these scripts defines the following functions:

* For commands:
    * module_help
    * module_options
    * module_cmd
* For subcommands
    * submodule_help
    * submodule_options
    * submodule_cmd

The main `tour-guide` script sources the command script requested and executes the `module_cmd` function.  For subcommands, the corresponding command script sources the subcommand script and executes the `submodule_cmd` function.

## Commands ##

Each command has its own parameters and help message.  Use `tour-guide <command> --help` to get help about a specific `<command>`.  If a command has subcommands, use `tour-guide <command> <subcommand> --help` to get help about that specific `<subcommand>`.
